Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tom Konidas and I am a [BEAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEAM_(Erlang_virtual_machine)) focused software developer from MontrÃ©al.

I solve software problems with real-time distributed systems, currently
specializing in [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/), [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) and
[Nerves](https://www.nerves-project.org/) applications. Outside of playing
around with cool new tech, you can catch me making music, shooting videos and
taking rad pictures.
